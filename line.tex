The \rule command constructs a box, which is treated like a character and has the following syntax  \rule[h]{w}{t} where h w and t are lengths and represent respectively:

the height above the baseline to which raise the box (defaults at 0)

the width of the box

the thickness of the rule

In your case

\par\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}
should do the trick.
